    "-  built-ins, which are compiled into Python\n",
    "-  file-based modules, which are accessed via the interpreter's resident file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python searches for file-based modules in the directories listed in `sys.path`.  \n",

    "Updating `sys.path` changes how Python searches for modules.\n",

    "-  `os.mkdir` - creates a directory\n",
    "-  `sys.path` - names directories that Python will search for modules\n",
