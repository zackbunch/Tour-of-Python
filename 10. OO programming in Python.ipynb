    "Like other OO languages, Python supports encapsulation.  An object B that an object A contains must, by default, be referenced \"through\" A, using an expression like `A.B`. The one exception to this rule involves the use multi-part `import` statements, like *from A import B*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike compiled OO languages, Python lacks support for strong data hiding.  Declarations like \"public\", \"private\" and \"protected\" that are standard for compiled OO languages are absent from Python. To put this point in another way, **data hiding in Python is a programmer-enforced convention**. With the exception of a few built-in immutable classes and constants, all Python identifiers are ultimately readable and updateable, as are the objects they reference. The standard rationale for this lack of checking is threefold:\n",
    "-  Enforcing data hiding in the absence of static type-checking would slow every data access.    Most of these checks, moreover, would be useless and redundant.\n",
    "-  Treating data hiding as a convention rather than a requirement gives programmers freedom to break data hiding at need.\n",
    "-  Ultimately, given the expressive power of constructs like `eval` and `exec`, enforcing data hiding may be a lost cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does support one weak mechanism for data hiding.  This mechanism, *name mangling*, is invoked automatically for\n",
    "attributes whose names start with a double underscore.  Python manages these attributes by\n",
    "-  assigning them new names and\n",
    "-  converting all references to these attributes from within their container objects to these new names\n",
    "\n",
    "This transforming of attribute names effectively invalidates all external references to the \"real\" names.  This transformation, however, is easily circumvented."

    "##  10.2 Dependency inversion <a name='OO-Programming-In-Python-Dependency-Inversion'></a>\n",
    "The term \"dependency inversion\" refers to the structuring of a family of modules as codes with a common interface. In compiled languages, type-related considerations require that the common interface be defined as a base class, which is then specialized to address the needs of particular realizations of that interface.  A classic explanation for the approach posits a base class that returns a time of day, coupled with a set of child classes that retrieve time-of-day information from different kinds of timepieces, ranging from digital assistants to digital clocks to sundials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"dependency inversion\" was coined at a time when objects first started to supplant procedures as the primary basis for software design.  The approach was developed as an alternative to *run-time type inference* (RTTI):  a design strategy that\n",
    "-  treats related modules that have different preconditions for operation as different entities, and\n",
    "-  selects which module to call at run-time via a series of tests that assess the current execution context.\n",
    "RTTI is now viewed as an awful design practice, because it potentially hinders program evolution. In RTTI-based codes, adding modules to or removing modules from a given family of modules can force changes to *all* codes that access *any* of these modules.  Dependency inversion, by contrast, localizes such changes to the modules proper, so long as those modules' common interfaces can be kept constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In interpreted languages, the lack of compile-time type checking eliminates the need to define a base class in order to assure the child class's type consistency with their context of use.  So long as a class has attributes that fit a given context, their parent object's type is assumed to be acceptable.  This approach to type checking is referred to as *latent* typing or *duck* typing:  i.e., if an object walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, assume it's a duck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent typing is favored by a minimalist school of software design, including authorities like Russ Olsen (<u>Eloquent Ruby</u>) who argue for achieving software quality by\n",
    "-  writing concise programs with clearly named variables\n",
    "-  supporting them with carefully crafted regression test suites.\n",
    "\n",
    "These authorities criticize type declarations and hard-coded type checks as syntactic clutter:  constructs that attempt to prevent potential errors that would be better prevented by careful attention to naming and regression testing.  While these authorities promote inheritance as a means of eliminating duplicate code, they see it as useless for defining types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Python constructs used in these examples:\n",
    "- `ABCMeta` - a Python *metaclass* that prevents a class from being used to instantiate other classes; the constrained   class is similar to abstract base classes in compiled OO languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful terminology:\n",
    "- *metaclass* - a class that controls the operation of a class.  All classes have metaclasses: the default is `object`.   Programming with metaclasses is something of a specialty in its own right; for more information, see (e.g.) \n",
    "  - Mark Lutz's <u>Learning Python</u>, 5th edition\n",
    "  - Mark Summerfield's <u>Python3</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples use the following Python library resources:\n",
    "-  `input` - read a string from the user's terminal\n",
    "-  `time.strftime` - display time of day as a string\n"
