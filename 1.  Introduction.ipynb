    "-  its widespread adoption by the software community, as attested to by\n",

    "   -  its use in enterprises like Google and the U.S. Dept. of Energy;\n",

    "-  its support for multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming; and\n",

    "Python was created by a Dutch graduate student, Guido von Rossum, as a simple language for programming distributed operating systems.  The old Python manifesto, which is still displayed by Python interpreters when one executes *import this*, describes Python as a language that provides exactly one, best way of doing things. Over time, however, Python has become as feature-rich-- or, for some, bloated-- as any contemporary object-oriented (OO) language. Still, Python's syntax and interpreter help make the language easy to code-- and much can be coded in a relatively small subset of Python.\n",

    "Python combines features of three major programming paradigms in common use.\n",
    "-  It's *procedural*, meaning that logic can be framed in terms of \"plain old\" loops, functions, and assignment statements.\n",
    "-  It's *object-oriented*, meaning that logic can be framed in terms of classes, along with classic mechanisms of class-based logic,    such as (multiple) inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "-  It supports *functional* programming, including generators and library methods that operate on streams of values.\n",
    "All three paradigms are featured on this document.\n",

This document's explanations, examples, and exercises are meant to convey a feel for key language features,  as well as for what differentiates interpreted languages like Python from compiled languages: e.g.,\n",
    "-  the ability to dynamically generate and execute code;\n",
    "-  the joys and headaches of type-declaration-free variable management; and\n",
